We obtained the patient's pictures to demonstrate her current state in October of 2018 with her permission. Close-up pictures of (V) anterior view of the trunk and legs, (VI) back of the legs, (VII) arms, and (VIII) back of the neck. B, вЂњFat shadowвЂќ obtained from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan showing fat distribution consistent with generalized fat loss but with some preservation around the neck. Total fat percentage was reported as 22%, the trunk-to-total fat mass ratio was 0.61, and legs-to-total fat mass ratio was 0.24. C, Deltoid muscle biopsy studied with ATPase assay at pH 9.4 with remarkable fiber size disproportion where the type 1 fibers were 45% smaller than the type 2 fibers. Fiber size disproportion (FSD) is an important feature of the Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) pathology and it was remarkably high in our first patient (Fig. 1). Fresh frozen tissue studied for abnormal lack of emerin protein expression by immunohistochemical staining would have been helpful to support the diagnosis of the x-linked form of EDMD caused by STA gene mutation on chromosome Xq28. Most LMNA gene mutations show no alteration in the lamin A/C protein and cannot be detected by immunohistochemical staining. FSD (formerly a subset of congenital fiber type disproportion) is a spectacular feature of a number of muscle abnormalities. The differential diagnosis of muscle diseases that cause FSD includes specific muscular diseases, polymyositis, mitochondrial myopathy, Pompe disease, mutations in the insulin receptor gene, congenital hypothyroidism, phosphofructokinase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency, and at least 5 congenital myopathies. In this case, the patient's age and presentation decrease this differential. Another important pathologic feature of this case is an ongoing non-inflammatory myopathy, revealed by regenerating muscle fibers. This and steadily elevated creatine kinase levels in this patient's blood suggest a muscular dystrophy. Specific diseases that cause FSD are Becker (more often than Duchenne) muscular dystrohy, myotonic dystrophy, rigid-spine syndrome, and EDMD. Other causes of FSD include certain central nervous system and peripheral nervous system diseases, skeletal disorders, and rare syndromes that do not pertain to this case.

       "   'Road map for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over the last decade, there has been a paradigm shift in pharmaceutical manufacturing, moving away from fixed processes, where product quality is confirmed solely though end-product testing, to the Quality by Design paradigm (QbD). QbD is a systematic scientific and risk-based approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing where quality is built-in through product and process understanding. Continuous manufacturing represents the next paradigm shift and provides an opportunity, through integration and the application of systems-based approaches, to adopt advanced manufacturing process development and control systems to produce high quality products. This reduces waste resulting from the generation of out-of-specification material. Since in its ultimate manifestation, a continuous process is designed as a whole, the distinction between the drug substance process and the drug product process can potentially be eliminated. This blue sky vision can be achieved through the adoption of novel process technologies',\n",

       "   'Calculation of optimal minimum required dilution (MRD): results of parallelism assessment for six individual matrix samples for a single analyte. In this figure, non-parallelism is apparent over part of the dilution range. Where there is parallelism across neat and diluted samples, no dilution will be required (1). The first chart shows test results adjusted for the dilution factor for all dilutions plotted against the actual dilution. In this example, the results increase as the dilution increases (due to matrix interference of some type) until it levels out. A consensus of results is observed once the interference effects have been sufficiently diluted out. In this chart, the dilutions from 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 appear to have good consensus. This effectively indicates that an MRD of 1/8 is potentially needed (2). The second chart shows the same data calculated as % recovery using the neat sample result as the 100% target value. The red dashed lines are the acceptance limits for this particular case, and clearly, the results fall out with those, due to the matrix interference in the inadequately diluted samples (3). The next step to prove that the variance from 1/8 to 1/32 results is acceptable is to recalculate the % recovery but now using the 1/8 dilution results as the 100% target. Here, the variance of higher dilutions up to 1/32 meets the acceptance criteria and proves that the MRD is 1/8. It also shows that diluting samples up to 1/32 would achieve acceptable results. Parallelism is therefore shown between the 1/8 and the 1/32 dilutions. This example shows a single analyte across six individual matrix samples. It may be more appropriate to use a larger number of samples when conducting this test, although there is often difficulty in obtaining matrix with significant concentrations of the biomarker of interest to allow multiple dilutions to be assessed that result in levels within the analytical range. It is recommended that this experiment is conducted for every analyte in the multiplex panel. It is usually easier to assess data results in this way on an analyte-by-analyte basis rather than by presenting multiple analytes together from a single sample',\n",
       "   'Determining parallelism when sufficient endogenous marker is present in matrix. Red dashed line indicates assay acceptance limits (в‰¤23%вЂ”equivalent to В±3Г— inter-assay CV% for these particular methods). This is a parallelism experiment covering two different analytes. The lines represent mean % recovery of six different matrix samples. It demonstrates that there is a matrix interference effect when using a dilution of less than 1/8 (analyte #1вЂ”blue) or 1/16 (analyte #2вЂ”brown). Consensus is achieved over the dilution range of 1/8 to 1/32 and 1/16 to 1/64, respectively. Hence, different analytes may demonstrate different MRDs, and so for multiplexed assays, the analytical ranges and sensitivities of all the analytes combined may be compromised due to one or more analytes that require different MRDs. In this example, a dilution of 1/16 minimum must be used to capture valid results from both analytes. Larger multiplexes may give more differences, but overall, the largest MRD required will need to be used unless certain analytes are withdrawn from the panel. This could be because the resulting analytical range or sensitivity limits of the analytes are unsatisfactory due to the particular requirements of the project']},\n",
