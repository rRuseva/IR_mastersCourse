B, вЂњFat shadowвЂќ obtained from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan showing fat distribution consistent with generalized fat loss but with some preservation around the neck.

C, Deltoid muscle biopsy studied with ATPase assay at pH 9.4 with remarkable fiber size disproportion where the type 1 fibers were 45% smaller than the type 2 fibers. Fiber size disproportion (FSD) is an important feature of the Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) pathology and it was remarkably high in our first patient (Fig. 1). Fresh frozen tissue studied for abnormal lack of emerin protein expression by immunohistochemical staining would have been helpful to support the diagnosis of the x-linked form of EDMD caused by STA gene mutation on chromosome Xq28. Most LMNA gene mutations show no alteration in the lamin A/C protein and cannot be detected by immunohistochemical staining. FSD (formerly a subset of congenital fiber type disproportion) is a spectacular feature of a number of muscle abnormalities. The differential diagnosis of muscle diseases that cause FSD includes specific muscular diseases, polymyositis, mitochondrial myopathy, Pompe disease, mutations in the insulin receptor gene, congenital hypothyroidism, phosphofructokinase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency, and at least 5 congenital myopathies. In this case, the patient's age and presentation decrease this differential. Another important pathologic feature of this case is an ongoing non-inflammatory myopathy, revealed by regenerating muscle fibers. This and steadily elevated creatine kinase levels in this patient's blood suggest a muscular dystrophy. Specific diseases that cause FSD are Becker (more often than Duchenne) muscular dystrohy, myotonic dystrophy, rigid-spine syndrome, and EDMD. Other causes of FSD include certain central nervous system and peripheral nervous system diseases, skeletal disorders, and rare syndromes that do not pertain to this case.

      "Road map for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over the last decade, there has been a paradigm shift in pharmaceutical manufacturing, moving away from fixed processes, where product quality is confirmed solely though end-product testing, to the Quality by Design paradigm (QbD). QbD is a systematic scientific and risk-based approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing where quality is built-in through product and process understanding. Continuous manufacturing represents the next paradigm shift and provides an opportunity, through integration and the application of systems-based approaches, to adopt advanced manufacturing process development and control systems to produce high quality products. This reduces waste resulting from the generation of out-of-specification material. Since in its ultimate manifestation, a continuous process is designed as a whole, the distinction between the drug substance process and the drug product process can potentially be eliminated. This blue sky vision can be achieved through the adoption of novel process technologies\n",

      "Case study 1 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in two subjects after a rapid intravenous injection of the same dose. An apparent mono-exponential decline is shown in plasma corresponding to a one-compartment system. The back-extrapolated concentration at time zero is approximately 1000В ОјgВ Lв€’1 in both subjects suggesting the same volume of distribution. Clearance Cl of test compound is larger in subject 2 which is manifested in a smaller area-under-the plasma concentration-time curve AUC and a shorter half-life (35В min) as compared to subject 1 (65В min). Case study 2 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in two groups of rats after a rapid intravenous injection of the same dose of recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rh-SOD). An apparent bi-exponential decline is shown in plasma corresponding to a two-compartment system (right). The back-extrapolated concentration at time zero is approximately 1000В ОјgВ mLв€’1 in both groups suggesting similar central volumes of distribution. Clearance Cl of the test compound is larger in normal rats which is manifested in a smaller AUC. The small red arrows indicate the elimination phase in normal (initial phase) and clamped (diseased, terminal phase) rats. The effective half-life is about 10В min (close to initial phase) in normal animals as compared to 90В min (terminal phase) in clamped animals. Cld, V c, and V t denote inter-compartmental distribution parameter and central and peripheral volume terms, respectively. V ss is the sum of the two volume terms. Case study 3 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in one subject after an oral dose. An apparent initial delay in the rise of plasma test compound concentrations is followed by a rapid initial upswing with a C max at about 60В min and then a post-peak mono-exponential decline corresponding to a one-compartment input/output system (right). Superimposed on experimental data (filled symbols) are the lag time and no lag time model fits. Note how the lack of a lag time misses the initial 10вЂ“20-min delay, the rise in experimental data, the peak concentration, and over predicts the terminal time points. A tentative time course after intravenous administration is shown as a dotted red line. This implies that the terminal portion of oral data shows absorption rate-limited eliminationвЂ”flip-flop pharmacokinetics. Cl, F, K a, and t lag denote clearance, bioavailability, absorption rate constant, and lag time, respectively. Case study 4 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in one subject after intravenous and oral dosing at two different occasions. Intravenous data (solid squares) display a bi-exponential decline which suggests a typical two-compartment disposition (see model inset). Oral data shows an apparent initial delay in the rise of plasma test compound concentrations which is then followed by a rapid initial upswing with a C max at about 50В min and then a post-peak weak bi-exponential decline (solid circles). Data from both routes of administration were simultaneously fit by the two-compartment model with either bolus or first-order input.

An apparent mono-exponential decline is shown in plasma corresponding to a one-compartment system. The back-extrapolated concentration at time zero is approximately 1000В ОјgВ Lв€’1 in both subjects suggesting the same volume of distribution. Clearance Cl of test compound is larger in subject 2 which is manifested in a smaller area-under-the plasma concentration-time curve AUC and a shorter half-life (35В min) as compared to subject 1 (65В min). Case study 2 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in two groups of rats after a rapid intravenous injection of the same dose of recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rh-SOD). An apparent bi-exponential decline is shown in plasma corresponding to a two-compartment system (right). The back-extrapolated concentration at time zero is approximately 1000В ОјgВ mLв€’1 in both groups suggesting similar central volumes of distribution. Clearance Cl of the test compound is larger in normal rats which is manifested in a smaller AUC. The small red arrows indicate the elimination phase in normal (initial phase) and clamped (diseased, terminal phase) rats. The effective half-life is about 10В min (close to initial phase) in normal animals as compared to 90В min (terminal phase) in clamped animals.

Superimposed on experimental data (filled symbols) are the lag time and no lag time model fits. Note how the lack of a lag time misses the initial 10вЂ“20-min delay, the rise in experimental data, the peak concentration, and over predicts the terminal time points.

A consensus of results is observed once the interference effects have been sufficiently diluted out. In this chart, the dilutions from 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 appear to have good consensus.

The red dashed lines are the acceptance limits for this particular case, and clearly, the results fall out with those, due to the matrix interference in the inadequately diluted samples (3). The next step to prove that the variance from 1/8 to 1/32 results is acceptable is to recalculate the % recovery but now using the 1/8 dilution results as the 100% target.
