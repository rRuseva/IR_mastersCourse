Over the last decade, there has been a paradigm shift in pharmaceutical manufacturing, moving away from fixed processes, where product quality is confirmed solely though end-product testing, to the Quality by Design paradigm (QbD). QbD is a systematic scientific and risk-based approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing where quality is built-in through product and process understanding. Continuous manufacturing represents the next paradigm shift and provides an opportunity, through integration and the application of systems-based approaches, to adopt advanced manufacturing process development and control systems to produce high quality products. This reduces waste resulting from the generation of out-of-specification material.

Vertical lines divide three regions based on its solution stability profile (23): (i) high acidity, where atorvastatin calcium exhibits high lactone formation (pH <3), (ii) intermediate acidity (pH 3–6), and (iii) near neutral/basic, pH >6, where atorvastatin lactone is not formed in solution. Note that a major degradation of AC in the presence of stearic acid at 50°C is probably related to the low melting point of stearic acid reported to be between 46 and 65°C (35)"]}

An apparent mono-exponential decline is shown in plasma corresponding to a one-compartment system. The back-extrapolated concentration at time zero is approximately 1000 μg L−1 in both subjects suggesting the same volume of distribution. Clearance Cl of test compound is larger in subject 2 which is manifested in a smaller area-under-the plasma concentration-time curve AUC and a shorter half-life (35 min) as compared to subject 1 (65 min). Case study 2 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in two groups of rats after a rapid intravenous injection of the same dose of recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rh-SOD). An apparent bi-exponential decline is shown in plasma corresponding to a two-compartment system (right). The back-extrapolated concentration at time zero is approximately 1000 μg mL−1 in both groups suggesting similar central volumes of distribution. Clearance Cl of the test compound is larger in normal rats which is manifested in a smaller AUC. The small red arrows indicate the elimination phase in normal (initial phase) and clamped (diseased, terminal phase) rats. The effective half-life is about 10 min (close to initial phase) in normal animals as compared to 90 min (terminal phase) in clamped animals. Cld, V c, and V t denote inter-compartmental distribution parameter and central and peripheral volume terms, respectively. V ss is the sum of the two volume terms. Case study 3 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in one subject after an oral dose. An apparent initial delay in the rise of plasma test compound concentrations is followed by a rapid initial upswing with a C max at about 60 min and then a post-peak mono-exponential decline corresponding to a one-compartment input/output system (right). Superimposed on experimental data (filled symbols) are the lag time and no lag time model fits. Note how the lack of a lag time misses the initial 10–20-min delay, the rise in experimental data, the peak concentration, and over predicts the terminal time points. A tentative time course after intravenous administration is shown as a dotted red line. This implies that the terminal portion of oral data shows absorption rate-limited elimination—flip-flop pharmacokinetics. Cl, F, K a, and t lag denote clearance, bioavailability, absorption rate constant, and lag time, respectively. Case study 4 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data in one subject after intravenous and oral dosing at two different occasions. Intravenous data (solid squares) display a bi-exponential decline which suggests a typical two-compartment disposition (see model inset). Oral data shows an apparent initial delay in the rise of plasma test compound concentrations which is then followed by a rapid initial upswing with a C max at about 50 min and then a post-peak weak bi-exponential decline (solid circles). Data from both routes of administration were simultaneously fit by the two-compartment model with either bolus or first-order input.

Data shows no delay prior to the rapid rise in plasma test compound concentrations with a C max at about 30 min. The post-peak data displays a bi-exponential decline. The red dashed line is the time course of an extended release dosage formulation with a slow absorption rate resulting in a late peak. The absorption is faster than the elimination since both curves fall in parallel terminally. Also, note the lack of the initially high concentration peak which the extended release will mask due to a slow release rate from the dosage form. Cl, V c, V t, Cld, F, and K a denote clearance, central volume, peripheral volume, inter-compartmental distribution, bioavailability, and absorption rate constant, respectively.

Case study 10 Semi-logarithmic plot of observed (symbols) and model-predicted (lines) concentration-time data after oral dosing of a test compound that utilizes an endogenous transporter route. The oral profiles display nonlinear absorption with a peak shift in C max with increasing doses. A typical bi-phasic decline is shown post-peak and below plasma concentrations of approximately 100 μg L−1. Note the flip-flop situation during the first 120 min at the highest dose where rate of elimination is confounded by absorption. F, V max, K m, V c, V t, Cld, and Cl denote bioavailability, maximum transport rate, the Michaelis-Menten constant related to the saturable absorption process, central volume, peripheral volume, inter-compartmental distribution, and clearance, respectively. Case study 11 Semi-logarithmic plot of concentration-time data obtained from a post-menopausal woman who received a rapid injection of 10 nmol of estradiol.

A multiplex assay was developed for serum apolipoproteins (Apo) on the Luminex platform. For the Apo AII assay (a), the optimal dilution was 1:200,000; however, the optimal dilution for Apo B (c) and Apo E (d) is closer to the 1:2000 range, with samples falling below the LLOQ at 1:200,000. Conversion of the Apo AII assay to the competitive format (b) decreased the assay sensitivity to bring the optimal dilution down to 1:2000. The calibrators are represented by the blue circles, and patient samples (n = 49) are represented by green squares", "Calculation of optimal minimum required dilution (MRD): results of parallelism assessment for six individual matrix samples for a single analyte. In this figure, non-parallelism is apparent over part of the dilution range. Where there is parallelism across neat and diluted samples, no dilution will be required (1). The first chart shows test results adjusted for the dilution factor for all dilutions plotted against the actual dilution. In this example, the results increase as the dilution increases (due to matrix interference of some type) until it levels out. A consensus of results is observed once the interference effects have been sufficiently diluted out. In this chart, the dilutions from 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 appear to have good consensus. This effectively indicates that an MRD of 1/8 is potentially needed (2). The second chart shows the same data calculated as % recovery using the neat sample result as the 100% target value. The red dashed lines are the acceptance limits for this particular case, and clearly, the results fall out with those, due to the matrix interference in the inadequately diluted samples (3). The next step to prove that the variance from 1/8 to 1/32 results is acceptable is to recalculate the % recovery but now using the 1/8 dilution results as the 100% target. Here, the variance of higher dilutions up to 1/32 meets the acceptance criteria and proves that the MRD is 1/8. It also shows that diluting samples up to 1/32 would achieve acceptable results. Parallelism is therefore shown between the 1/8 and the 1/32 dilutions. This example shows a single analyte across six individual matrix samples. It may be more appropriate to use a larger number of samples when conducting this test, although there is often difficulty in obtaining matrix with significant concentrations of the biomarker of interest to allow multiple dilutions to be assessed that result in levels within the analytical range. It is recommended that this experiment is conducted for every analyte in the multiplex panel. It is usually easier to assess data results in this way on an analyte-by-analyte basis rather than by presenting multiple analytes together from a single sample", "Determining parallelism when sufficient endogenous marker is present in matrix. Red dashed line indicates assay acceptance limits (≤23%—equivalent to ±3× inter-assay CV% for these particular methods). This is a parallelism experiment covering two different analytes. The lines represent mean % recovery of six different matrix samples. It demonstrates that there is a matrix interference effect when using a dilution of less than 1/8 (analyte #1—blue) or 1/16 (analyte #2—brown). Consensus is achieved over the dilution range of 1/8 to 1/32 and 1/16 to 1/64, respectively. Hence, different analytes may demonstrate different MRDs, and so for multiplexed assays, the analytical ranges and sensitivities of all the analytes combined may be compromised due to one or more analytes that require different MRDs. In this example, a dilution of 1/16 minimum must be used to capture valid results from both analytes. Larger multiplexes may give more differences, but overall, the largest MRD required will need to be used unless certain analytes are withdrawn from the panel. This could be because the resulting analytical range or sensitivity limits of the analytes are unsatisfactory due to the particular requirements of the project"]}

Upregulated PI3K/Akt activation also stimulates metabolic enzymes (i. e. hexokinase) to drive tumour metabolism. Cancer cells are reliant on mitochondrial metabolism for the increase of glucose to satisfy increased energy requirements. Glucose enters the cell via the glucose transporter (GLUT) to initiate glycolysis. HKII binds to voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) to form a complex. Thus, the simultaneous inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway and tumour metabolism pathway was explored. Gefitinib binds to the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR to inhibit the activation of EGFR signalling whilst PENAO is transported across the plasma membrane and enters the mitochondrial matrix to interact with Cys57 and Cys257 residues in the ANT, perturb the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and decrease ATP delivery to the cancer cell.", "xCELLigence real-time cell proliferation analysis of HOS, HT1080 and SW982 cell lines was recorded in real-time (A). 24 hours after seeding, cells were treated with PENAO, gefitinib and combination.

Before surgery, determination of tumor burden in plasma has the potential to help guide neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy and monitor response, using large panels or patient-specific assays based on the molecular profile of the tissue biopsy when available. After surgery, NGS (large gene panels or patient-specific assays) can detect MRD and guide adjuvant therapy (early detection) or detect relapse. Low tumor shed in plasma will be the main limitation to the integration of plasma genotyping in early stage disease. Advanced stage disease: At diagnosis, ctDNA can guide genotype-directed therapy (using targeted assays focusing on a predefined gene of interest (i. e. EGFR in NSCLC) or targeted NGS covering genes of interest). The variations in allelic fractions allow for monitoring of treatment response, which may be helpful for pharmacodynamics analyses in phase I studies. When acquired resistance to targeted therapies occurs, ctDNA can detect specific mechanisms of resistance (targeted assay like for EGFR T790M or targeted NGS), taking into consideration the different clones present within the primary tumor (P) and all metastatic sites (M1, M2), and guide treatment adjustments."]}
